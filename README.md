#### Description:

RNS Cart is a full-stack ecommerce website developed using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite. It offers a comprehensive shopping platform where users can register, log in, browse products, add items to their cart, place orders, and manage favorites. The platform also includes an admin panel for inventory management and order tracking.

User authentication is securely handled by Flask, ensuring that user accounts are protected. Products are categorized for easy navigation, and users can view their order history, track order status, and mark products as favorites for quick access.

The backend is powered by Flask, leveraging its simplicity and flexibility to handle HTTP requests and manage the application logic. SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM for database interactions, providing a seamless interface to the SQLite database.

Frontend design is enhanced with Bootstrap for responsive layouts and Font Awesome for icons, ensuring a modern and intuitive user experience. Flask-WTF is used for form handling and validation, while Flask-Login manages user sessions securely.

To get started, simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, set up the database, and run the Flask server. Once the server is running, users can access the website through their browser and begin exploring the catalog of products, adding items to their cart, and placing orders. Administrators can log in to the admin panel to manage products and monitor orders efficiently.
